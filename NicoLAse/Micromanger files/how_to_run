Having Micro-Manager v2.0 or higher is a prerequisite to running this.
Paste NicoLase.jar in the MM plugins directory, which is usually located at C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager-2.0\mmplugins
Paste both the NicoLase_config_file.txt and NicoLase_config_file.cfg in the main MM directory: C:\Program Files\Micro-Manager-2.0
The .cfg file is the hardware configuration file that Micro-Manager uses to read and interface with the Arduino board.
The .txt file can be edited as per the requirements of the procedure:


                      Arduino Com Port : 3                             ==> change value of COM port as per system
                      Number of Arduino Channels (up to 6) : 4         ==> 4 channels were used for the purpose of the project, but the maximum number of usable                                                                              channels depends on the type of Arduino Board being used
                      Channel Names : 404 nm,491 nm,517 nm,561 nm      ==> channel names can be any arbitrary term to demarcate and identify different                                                                                      apparatuses being connected to the board, but it is best to use laser wavelength for                                                                            easy identification
                      Trigger Property name : Trigger
                      Software Trigger Option : Software               ==> sets what triggers the board. for better and seamless interface, software is                                                                                    recommended
                      External Trigger Option : External               ==> sets external trigger option. external trigger here means that the Arduino board will                                                                            send all trigger signals to the lasers and cameras
                     
 IMPORTANT: Change the value of COM port in the .cfg file as well, otherwise board/software interface will NOT occur
