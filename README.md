# nicolase_onthego
A shorter and hopefully slightly simplified version of the NicoLase laser array setup. The original repository can be found here: https://github.com/PRNicovich/NicoLase
A more streamlined version of the Micro-Manager/Arduino interfacing process, including some files that were not there on the original repo
The purpose of this re-iteration of the NicoLase project is to implement in a somehwat more simplified and easy to understand manner
